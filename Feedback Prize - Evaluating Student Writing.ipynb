       "[{'text': \"During a group project, have you ever asked a group member about adding or replacing something? Or, when you were studying for a math test, did you ever ask your parents or sibling about different ways to tackle a certain problem? Asking for other's opinions is especially beneficial as it allows for an individual to receive a variety of different views towards a given topic. Likewise, being diverse and asking many people for their opinions allows one to understand how most people percieve something. This is especially important as knowing multiple opinions can allow someone to take those views into account and sway themseleves to the general audience. Knowing different people's opinion can be beneficial in a variety of situations.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, a great example about how knowing other's opinions is helpful is when someone is making the choice between smoking or refraining from smoking. A student can watch on a TV channel that smoking is bad, and can damage their internal organs. However, on another channel, the student can find advertisements about the most addicting smoking device that can release the most dopomine in the brain, all the while not severly harming people's lungs. This student will receive a variety of different views and opinions on a certain topic, which allows them to make the best educated choice or decision based on how they interpret what they saw. Similarily, a student can be told from his fellow classmates that smoking is fun, joyful, and makes them happy. However, if the student asks a local doctor, they will be informed differently. A doctor will most likely tell them that smoking, although seeming harmless at first, can lead to serious long term consequences.\\n\\nIf the student asks both his friends and his doctors, he is able to use his judgemental skills to determing which choice will be best for him in the long run.\\n\\nFurthermore, asking for multiple opinions can benifit during competitions for a position slot, as cadidates needs to make decisions on what they need to say or do. For example, it can be helpful in situations like elections, both for the U.S. or simply in school. If a student is running for a position in office to represent his/her school, he/she can ask a widespread and diverse audience. First, asking other students is their best bet to obtaining information. Other students can inform him/her about what they want, like better water fountains, recess, or healthier food. Then, the student running can make changes to the way they run for the election, and on his/her speech, take a different approach. In addition, if the student running asks an adult, they will get to know a more realistic way the school can be improved. Since a student, even as a student officer, isn't able to make a significant change to a school, they can inform the school board about ways to make the school better. If someone is running for the president of the United States, a similar approach can be taken. First, they can ask the people, on social media or in speeches, about positive ways to reform our country. After the candidate receives the opinion of general audiences, they can campaign differently to match the view of those voting. All in all, asking for the opinion of multiple different people can set the candidate apart from others.\\n\\nMany people only ask one type of audience for their opinion. Having only one opinion can lead to negative consequences, such as making the wrong choices related to health or education, as only one audience is adressed into making a decision. Therefore, asking multiple different people who have different backgrounds is essential to making the best choices in life. Conclusively, knowing multiple opinions on a certain matter can evidently lead to better results for individuals.Â\\xa0\",\n",

       " {'text': \"80% of Americans believe seeking multiple opinions can help them make better choices, and for good reason. Studies have shown the average Americans faring far better in their lives compared to their counterparts because they are listening to other's advice. There are also many myths that have the moral of listening to other people's opinions. For example, Perseus got his achievement of slaying a gorgon because he listened to the Oracle. Another example I have is the fable of Osiris, in which Osiris listens to Sekhmet and becomes the king of he underworld. In all of these stories, the hero listens to other people, and benefited from the people around them being more knowledgeable, more experienced, and giving the hero more choices to consider. Therefore, I believe listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice because they have more experience compared to you, know the pros and cons of your choice, and gives you multiple perspectives to deliberate over.\\n\\nFor example, let us talk about the anecdote of little Generic_Name, whose life was changed forever by listening to a person who has more experience than him. As a young lad, little Generic_Name always dreamed of becoming a soldier, because he admired his mother who fought in WW2. But Generic_Name's mother, who lived through the inhospitable battlefield, didnt want her child to follow her path. As a result, she talked to him about the hardships that plagued her when she was a soldier, and successfully changed his mind. Thanks to Generic_Name's mother changing little Generic_Name's mind, He became a successful and joyous doctor who saves countless of lives every day. If Generic_Name's mother hadn't been a soldier who has lived through the darkest depths of hell called the battlefield, then she wouldn't have been able to change little Generic_Name's mind, and he may have had his life cut short. Another story we can talk about is the story of little Generic_Name, who always wanted to be a magician. Generic_Name always fantasizes about being on stage, listening to the crowds wild applause as she entertains them, and thankfully, her father is there to fulfill her fantasies. Thanks to Generic_Name's father being a renowned magician, he had the connections and knew the tricks that could excite the crowd. As a result, Generic_Name became the greatest magician of that generation. If Generic_Name's father wasnt a magician who had walked the path Generic_Name was planning to walk, then she wouldnt have been able to reach the heights she was reaching right now. Therefore, I believe that listening to people who have more experiences compared to you an help you make a better judgment.\\n\\nAnother anecdote we can talk about is the anecdote of Generic_Name, a menacing ancient man who knew the pros and cons of doing drugs. As Generic_Name was walking the streets of New Jersey, he saw a group about to eat drugs. Generic_Name walked towards the group, and he latched his hand on to the nearest person's, and stopped the person from doing some drugs. Generic_Name reprimanded the group about doing drugs, and thanks to his menacing presence, the group stopped downing some pills. Thanks to the effort of Generic_Name who lectured the group about the pros and cons of eating drugs, the group was saved from the evil influences of drugs, and grew up to be a group who fought against drug use. If Generic_Name wasn't telling the group about the pros and cons of drugs, they would have eaten it and fallen into a path which is very hard to recover from. But thankfully, Generic_Name saved them from that despairing future. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted o be doctor. Generic_Name didn't know much about being a doctor, except that she wanted to be one, so her grandfather talked with her about her choice. As they discussed the pros and cons of being a doctor, Generic_Name grew more knowledgeable about the choice she is going to make. As a result, Generic_Name is much more firm in her beliefs about being a doctor, and grew up to be an amazing doctor. If she didnt' talk with her grandfather about her choice, she would have made an uniformed decision that likely would have ruined her life. Therefore, I believe that listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice by giving them the pros and cons of their choice.\\n\\nOne anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted to be a lawyer because her friend's advised her. She was steadfast in her beliefs as she always enjoyed rules and regulations, until her mother gave her a new perspective to mull over. She told her to aim to become a supreme dragon, rather than being a struggling python.\\n\\nAs a result, Generic_Name aimed to be a supreme judge, and she became one at the age of 65. Thanks to her mother giving her better advice, She became a star that outshone other's in the world of law. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name whose life changed thanks to a fateful encounter that changed his life. Generic_Name felt forced to be a fashion designer, as it was a family tradition.\\n\\nHe didn't know what to do, until he heard his grandmother talking with his family about animal cloning. He grew interested in animal cloning and researched it until he considered it a his future career. As a result, he grew up to become a biologist, doing something he loves. If it wasn't for his grandmother telling Generic_Name's family members about animal cloning, he wouldn't have even considered it, and may have grown to be a nihilistic person who isn't able to change his fate of suffering. Therefore, I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can give them multiple perspectives to consider.\\n\\nIn conclusion, little Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and many more changed their entire lives by listening to other people. If they didn't seek other's advice, they would have fallen into a path that would not allow their potential to bloom. But, thankfully, they chose to listen to other people. As a result, they grew to be figures that were respected around the world. Therefore, I in believe seeking multiple opinions.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"When people ask for advice,they sometimes talk to more than one person. Advice is an opinion,that's told to another person. I think advisesÂ\\xa0help people make better choices. Some reasons I think why advises helps is keeps you safe, makes goal come true, and makes changes.\\n\\nThe reason I think advises help is keeps you safe. There are many dangerous people and thing in the world. That could hurt you in so many ways. When I got invited to a sixteen and up birthday party. I was so ready to go but i didnt know if i should go to the party. So i asked my mom for advice. Then she told me it wouldn't be the best idea,I could get kidnapped. I agreed with her and didn't go. That advice from my mom saved me from getting kidnapped.\\n\\nAnother reason I think Advises help is make goals come true. Getting to your goal is pretty hard. But if you have someone to push you through it you can do it. When I gave up on becoming an Artist. My friend told me some advice telling I need to keep going until i reached my goal. And said she cheering for me. I felt hopeful again and happy that she there for me.\\n\\nThe last reason I think advises help is makes changes. Words are powerful and so are action. They can make things happen with multiple of them. At our school,the lunches are very unhealthy. We tell our teacher but they didn't listen. So we interview people around the school and asked them to sign a paper. Once we were done. We when over to the school board. And told them about the unhealthy lunches at schools. They agreed that schools should change their lunches to healthier lunches. And changed the lunches served a schools.\\n\\nAdvises can be helpful or not helpful. But if it can help you then please listen to it. Don't block it out .So many people think it's useless. But it help in so many like keep you safe,make goals come true or makes changes. You can't do everything on your. Sometime it's better to ask for help.   Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0   Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0   Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Making choices in life can be very difficult. People often ask for advice when they can not decide on one thing. It's always good to ask others for their advice when making a choice. When you have multiple opinions you have the ability to make the best choice for yourself. Seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice because it can decrease stress levels, a great chance to learn something new, can be very helpful and beneficial.\\n\\nTo begin with, Seeking information from more than one person can decrease stress levels. When making a decision there is a chance that you can become very stressed and overwhelmed. Being stressed can cause a person to give up on what they are doing. Having multiple opinions from people can make choosing an option less difficult and more easier. The information that you receive from others may have a special meaning in the future. Other peoples opinion can make a person feel confident in making the right choice.\\n\\nWhen you ask other people for their opinion you can also learn many new things. Everyone is different and may have more experience than you. Seeking other peoples opinion can cause you to gain a new skill or lesson. For example, someones advice could teach you how to do something the correct way. Many people are very different and have experience different things in life. Seeking advice from others can teach you a lot. We all learn from our mistakes in life, by sharing your past experiences you may prevent someone else from making the same mistake.\\n\\nSeeking others opinion can be very helpful and beneficial. Taking other peoples advice and doing what they say may lead to a great outcome. When you receive other opinions whether they are good or bad you will be able to look at them from a different point of view. For example, When a group of people give you advice on yourself, you then know how they look at you as a person. Everyone looks at certain things from a different prospective. How someone else looks at it may be how its supposed to be viewed in life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, You can learn from others experiences by seeking the advice that someone give you. Making decisions can cause stress on a person. Relating to someones advice may higher your self-esteem because you no longer feel left out. Ask others for advice when making a difficult decision. When you seek others opinion more opportunities are available fro yourself.Â\\xa0\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Have you ever asked more than one person for help on what product to buy in a situation? Interviews are a perfect example of seeking more than one opinion. Interviews are seen on the news, in professional sports, and other places as well. There are a lot of people that can help you buy the right product as well. They can all open you up to new ideas. I think talking to more than one person on an opinion is a better choice because it shows you more than one option, it can change your perspective of a topic, and it informs you about what other people enjoy.\\n\\nFirst, I think it shows you more than one option. One opinion of a person might destroy your choice on an option rather than opening it up. The whole point of asking what is the better choice, is to make it better, not worse. You could already have the better opinion, and that person might ruin it, but more people would give you a good balance of what you need to know. Multiple opinions can stride you toward different answers. Different answers will most of the time make things go in the right direction. Its good to show variety in what you're going to pick in order to get the best choice. One opinion could be someone who isn't informed on the idea. They might not know anything about the topic and might just state a random answer. That can really throw you off if you don't get more ideas than just that one person. That can have the same effect as what I said before. That one person could mess it all up for you. All of the people you ask shows you more than what you thought was the best choice.\\n\\nNext, it can change your perspective on the topic. One person can change your option, but it may not lead you in the right direction. That direction could make you unhappy with your choice if you are comparing a product to see which one to get. You could take that one persons advice and follow it, but it might not be the best advice you could get. Multiple people have a better chance of leading you to the right opinion. When you get the opinion of multiple people, it balances out what might be the favorite option, or what might be the better option. A lot of times, changing your opinion is for the better. You could be looking at the wrong choice, and multiple opinions might lead you to the right path. It gives new ideas and ways to look at a situation and make the right choice. It can make you change your opinion.\\n\\nFinally, it informs you about what other people enjoy. Having more than one person's opinion might lead to an agreement with those people. You could be really stuck on a certain product you are trying to buy, and someone could save that entire situation by finding a good version of that product. You could also learn more about culture and peoples opinions in a certain area, or a certain time. Many people are different and sometimes that is based off of the environment around them, and where they grow up that could affect what a person likes. If you ask multiple people in the same area you grew up in, you should be leading yourself to the right choice. It can also lead to meeting new people, and making new friends. You could agree on an opinion and start a bond there. It all helps you on knowing not only what you like, but what a lot of other people like.\\n\\nIn conclusion, finding more than one persons view is better because it shows more than one opinion, it can change your own opinion, and it can inform you on what other people enjoy. If you are ever interviewing people, or looking for advice from other people to make the right decision, make sure you ask multiple people andÂ\\xa0not just one person for that advice! I always ask friends, family, or other people for help and advice if I should do something or not. You've probably asked multiple people for advice as well!\",\n",
